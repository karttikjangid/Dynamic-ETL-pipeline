--- RAW PARAGRAPH
Widget A is a compact device for everyday use. It comes in multiple colors and often appears in scraped pages with noisy markup and unrelated text like promotional banners, comments, or code snippets. The price information is inconsistent in these pages and sometimes appears as "9.99 USD", "$9.99", or "9,99". Dates observed in different locales: 12/13/2025 and 13/12/2025 (ambiguous). Some text contains OCR errors from PDFs: \"l0cation\" instead of \"location\" and \"O\" vs \"0\" confusion.
